Inside this folder is contained the SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS folder referenced in the project final report.
That folder contains all of the figures and graphs along with two video simulations of the Simple Elastic Motor Clutch

Also contained in the folder is the code for the Processing video simulator. This code requires you to run the Simple Elastic
Matlab file. The Matlab file has a file writting section that must be uncommented. Running will then output and save all the figures
and the neccesaairy files for the visual simulation to the directory. The Processing code must be in the same directory as these files

When running the Processing code you can choose between different substrate stiffnesses by changing the s value in the parameter space.
An attempt was made to included visual indicators for clutch engagement and force but in this version has not been completed.

The main directory contains the requesite codes, final report and powerpoint presentation. The codes contained within are the modified
Matlab codes for simple and viscoelastic substrates along with the original code produced by Odde and Bangaser. Also contiained is the
Python reconstruction of the Odde code.
